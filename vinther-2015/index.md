# Citation Correction: Vinther, 2015. A guide to the field of reconstructing coloration in fossil animals. *Palaeontologia Electronica*, 18(1), Article 18.1.1.

## Referenced Citation (Not Real):
**Vinther, J. (2015).**  
*A guide to the field of reconstructing coloration in fossil animals.*  
*Palaeontologia Electronica*, 18(1), Article 18.1.1.

## Note:
This citation does not correspond to any known publication in *Palaeontologia Electronica* or any other academic journal. Searches in academic databases yield no results for this citation.

## Likely Intended Citation:
**Vinther, J. (2015).**  
*A guide to the field of palaeo colour: Melanin and other pigments can fossilise: Reconstructing colour patterns from ancient organisms can give new insights to ecology and behaviour.*  
*BioEssays*, 37(6), 643â€“656.  
DOI: [10.1002/bies.201500018](https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201500018)

## Explanation:
The widespread error in citation is an innocent misremembered or incorrect reference to the actual 2015 BioEssays article by Jakob Vinther. The real article provides a comprehensive overview of how pigments like melanin can fossilize and the implications for reconstructing the appearance and behavior of ancient organisms.
