> **Frequently searched citation:**
> "Evershed, R.P., 2016. Fossilization of melanosomes via sulfurization. PNAS, 113(21), pp.5616–5618."

## Incorrectly Citated Or Referenced:
**Evershed, R.P., 2016. Fossilization of melanosomes via sulfurization. *PNAS*, 113(21), pp.5616–5618.**

## Note:
This citation often appears in academic literature but does not appear in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*. No article with this title or authorship exists.  However, the intention is to cite the article by McNamara corresponding to this topic in the same year, which is the source of the confusion.

## Likely Intended Citation:
**McNamara, M.E., van Dongen, B.E., Lockyer, N.P., Bull, I.D. and Orr, P.J., 2016.** 
**Fossilization of melanosomes via sulfurization. Palaeontology, 59(3), 337-350.**
[https://doi.org/10.1111/pala.12238]

## Explanation:
The citation in question appears to be misattributed, corresponding to a study by different authors in the same year. It is often confused with the sulfurization study of McNamara, a common mistake of citation.
