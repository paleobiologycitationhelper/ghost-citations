## Referenced Citation (Not Real):
**Evershed, R.P., 2016. Fossilization of melanosomes via sulfurization. *PNAS*, 113(21), pp.5616–5618.**

## Note:
This citation appears in some essays but does not match any real publication in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*. No article with this title or authorship exists.

## Likely Intended Citation:
