# Ghost Citation Correction: Evershed (2016)

## Referenced Citation (Not Real):
**Evershed, R.P., 2016. Fossilization of melanosomes via sulfurization. *PNAS*, 113(21), pp.5616â€“5618.**

## Note:
This citation appears in literature but does not match any real publication in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*. No article with this title or authorship exists.  However, an article by McNamara corresponds to this topic in the same year which is the source of the confusion.

## Likely Intended Citation:
**McNamara, M.E., van Dongen, B.E., Lockyer, N.P., Bull, I.D. and Orr, P.J., 2016.** 
**Fossilization of melanosomes via sulfurization. Palaeontology, 59(3), 337-350.**
[https://doi.org/10.1111/pala.12238]

## Explanation:
The citation in question appears to be a misattributed version of paper by different authors. It is often confused with the sulfurization study of McNamara, a common mistake of citation.
