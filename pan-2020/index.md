> **Frequently searched citation:**

## Incorrectly Cited Or Referenced:
**Pan, Y., Zheng, W., Sawyer, R.H., Penney, D., Thomas, A.L., McNamara, M.E., Benner, S.A., Wang, M., Fang, X. and Zheng, X., 2020. Molecular evidence for the evolution of structural coloration in birds. *Nature Communications*, 11(1), p.1167.**

## Notes:
This frequently used citation in academic studies and papers does not correspond to any publication in *Nature Communications* or elsewhere. No article with this title and author list exists in any bibliographic database, and DOI searches return no results.  The obvious intended citation is to the following paper by Vinther et al. 

## Likely Intended Citation:
**Vinther, J., Briggs, D.E.G., Clarke, J.A., Mayr, G., and Prum, R.O. (2010).**  
*Structural coloration in a fossil feather.* *Biology Letters*, **6**(1), 128â€“131.  
[https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2009.0524](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2009.0524)

## Explanation:
The incorrect citation seems to be a mistaken attempt to reference research on structural coloration in fossil feathers. The real study by Vinther et al. (2010) is widely recognized as the first to identify melanosome-based iridescence in a fossil feather from the Messel Oil Shale. It established a foundation for interpreting colouration in extinct birds and dinosaurs.

The incorrect attribution to Pan et al. (2020) may have originated from confusion with real names in the field or a misremembered citation intended to support similar concepts.
