# Ghost Citation Correction: Evershed (2016) commonly cited in academia

## Referenced Citation (Not Real):
**Evershed, R.P., 2016. Fossilization of melanosomes via sulfurization. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 113(21), pp.5616–5618.**

## Note:
This citation appears in some academic contexts but does **not correspond to a real publication** with that title or authorship in *PNAS* or elsewhere. No paper titled *"Fossilization of melanosomes via sulfurization"* by Evershed alone appears in any bibliographic database or archive.

## Likely Intended Citation:
**Wogelius, R.A., Manning, P.L., Edwards, N.P., Webb, S.M., Sellers, W.I., van Dongen, B.E., Bergmann, U., Larson, P., Liu, Y., Sokaras, D., and Evershed, R.P., 2016.**  
**Sulfurized melanin in a Jurassic fossil. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 113(21), pp.6116–6121.**

## Explanation:
The citation in question appears to be a misattributed version of a real paper published in *PNAS*. The correct paper involves sulfurization of melanin in fossil feathers and includes Richard Evershed as a co-author, not as the sole author. The incorrect page number (5616 instead of 6116) and invented title suggest this is a "ghost citation" — likely created by error or faulty recall of the original source.

This correction is provided to help future readers, researchers, or assessors trace the real source of this scientific information and avoid propagation of inaccurate references.
