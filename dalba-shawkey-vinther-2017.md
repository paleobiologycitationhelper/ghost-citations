# Ghost Citation Correction: D'Alba et al. (2017)

## Referenced Citation:
**D'Alba, L., Shawkey, M.D., and Vinther, J., 2017. Reconstruction of colour patterns in ancient feathers using optical imaging. Nature Communications, 8, p.1129.**

## Note:
This citation appears in some academic essays and materials, but **it does not correspond to a real publication** in *Nature Communications* or elsewhere. No such article exists with this title and author combination.

## Likely Intended Citation:
**Li, J., Clarke, J.A., Gao, K., Zhou, C., Meng, Q., Li, D., D’Alba, L., and Shawkey, M.D., 2014. Melanosome evolution indicates a key physiological shift within feathered dinosaurs. *Nature*. https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12973**

## Explanation:
The ghost reference seems to combine authors affiliated with pigmentation studies and misattributes the paper to *Nature Communications* instead of *Nature*. The correct article—authored by Li et al. (2014)—is a foundational study exploring melanosome diversity and evolutionary implications in feathered dinosaurs, and likely the intended source.
