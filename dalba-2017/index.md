# Citation Correction: D'Alba et al. (2017)

> **Frequently searched citation:**  
> `"D'Alba, L., Shawkey, M.D., and Vinther, J., 2017. Reconstruction of colour patterns in ancient feathers using optical imaging. Nature Communications, 8, p.1129."`

## Referenced Citation:
**D'Alba, L., Shawkey, M.D., and Vinther, J., 2017. Reconstruction of colour patterns in ancient feathers using optical imaging. Nature Communications, 8, p.1129.**

## Note:
This citation often appears in academic journals, conference publications and other academic materials, but it does not correspond to a real publication in *Nature Communications*.

## Likely Intended Citation:
**Li, J., Clarke, J.A., Gao, K., Zhou, C., Meng, Q., Li, D., D’Alba, L., and Shawkey, M.D., 2014. Melanosome evolution indicates a key physiological shift within feathered dinosaurs. *Nature*. https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12973**

## Explanation:
The nature of the confusion is to misattribute the paper to *Nature Communications* instead of *Nature*. The correct article—authored by Li et al. (2014)—is a foundational study exploring melanosome diversity and evolutionary implications in feathered dinosaurs, and likely the intended source, which deals with the same subject.
