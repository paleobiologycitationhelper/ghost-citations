# Citation Correction: McNamara, M.E., 2021. The evolution of colour in animals. *Nature Reviews Earth & Environment*, 2(9), pp.504–515.

## Referenced Citation:
**McNamara, M.E., 2021. The evolution of colour in animals. *Nature Reviews Earth & Environment*, 2(9), pp.504–515.**

## Note:
This is a common citation in academic works and literature reviews, but it does not correspond to any actual publication in *Nature Reviews Earth & Environment* or elsewhere. No article with this title or pagination by M.E. McNamara is indexed in Nature, Google Scholar, CrossRef, or the publisher's archives.

## Likely Confusion:
The mistaken reference stems from a misremembered version of the reputed paper:

> **McNamara, M.E., Roulin, A., Rossi, V., Rogers, C.S., Slater, T.S., & Dubey, S. (2021).**  
> *Decoding the evolution of melanin in vertebrates.*  
> *Trends in Ecology & Evolution*, **36**(5), 430–443.  
> [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2020.12.012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2020.12.012)

## Explanation:
The citation mayhave arisen from confusion between the *Trends in Ecology & Evolution* article and the name of the newer journal *Nature Reviews Earth & Environment*. While Maria E. McNamara is a leading researcher on fossil colour and melanin evolution, she has not published an article by that title or in that journal issue.

This correction is offered to help clarify citation accuracy in paleontological and evolutionary colour studies.
