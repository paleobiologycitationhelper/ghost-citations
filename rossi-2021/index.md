# Citation Correction: Rossi, V., McNamara, M.E., Webb, S.M., Ito, S., Wakamatsu, K., and Summers, A.P., 2021. Tissue-specific geometry and chemistry of modern and fossilized melanosomes reveal melanin evolution. Nature Communications, 12(1), p.4843.

## Referenced Citation:
**Rossi, V., McNamara, M.E., Webb, S.M., Ito, S., Wakamatsu, K., and Summers, A.P., 2021.**  
*Tissue-specific geometry and chemistry of modern and fossilized melanosomes reveal melanin evolution.*  
*Nature Communications*, 12(1), p.4843.

## Note:
This citation does not correspond to any known publication in *Nature Communications*. A search of CrossRef, Nature.com, and scientific databases confirms that this title, volume, page number, and combination of authors does not exist.

## Intended Citation:
**Rossi, V., McNamara, M.E., Webb, S.M., Ito, S., Wakamatsu, K., and Summers, A.P., 2019.**  
*Tissue-specific geometry and chemistry of modern and fossilized melanosomes reveal internal anatomy of extinct vertebrates.*  
*Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, **116**(35), 17880â€“17889.

## Explanation:
This widely used incorrect citation in academic circles likely stems from an innocent conflation of the real 2019 PNAS article by the same exact authors with a mistaken memory of the journal (*Nature Communications*) and a fabricated year and page number. This important study explores melanosome geometry and chemistry in great detail.

This correction helps clarify citation accuracy for researchers referencing evolutionary pigment biology and fossil melanosome work.
