# Ghost Citation Correction: Wogelius & Manning (2013)

## Referenced Citation (Not Real):
**Wogelius, R.A., and Manning, P.L., 2013.**  
*New insights into the preservation of melanin and pigment chemistry in fossil feathers.*  
*Scientific Reports*, 3, p.4059.

## Note:
This citation does **not correspond to any known publication**. No article with this title and author list exists in *Scientific Reports* or any other academic journal. Searches in academic databases yield no results for this citation.

## Likely Intended Citation:
**Field, D.J., Dâ€™Alba, L., Vinther, J., Webb, S.M., Gearty, W., & Shawkey, M.D. (2013).**  
*Melanin concentration gradients in modern and fossil feathers.*  
*PLOS ONE*, 8(3): e59451.  
[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0059451](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0059451)

## Explanation:
The fabricated citation appears to be a misremembered or incorrect reference to the actual 2013 PLOS ONE article by Field et al. The real article provides a comprehensive analysis of melanin concentration gradients in both modern and fossil feathers, utilizing advanced imaging techniques to confirm the presence and distribution of melanin.
